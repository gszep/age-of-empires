# Dark Age skirmish handoff

## Run and play

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Public open-content URL: <https://empires.gszep.com/>
- Canonical local/imported desktop URL: <http://localhost:5173/>
- Tailnet/mobile QA URL (preserved): <https://calcifer.tail6e864b.ts.net:5173/>

Controls and hotkeys are listed in the root `README.md`. The essential loop is left/drag selection, right-click context orders, villager build commands, town-center/barracks training, and destruction of the opposing town center. `F10 → Load replay…` plays a headless record and checks its periodic hashes.

## Delivered scope

- Fixed-tick deterministic 1v1 simulation with integer resources, gathering/drop-off/depletion, building placement/construction, population, production queues, and rally orders.
- Deterministic tile A*, footprint obstruction, repathing/separation, DAT armor classes/minimum damage, discrete windup/release/cooldown, corpses, and defensive acquisition.
- Authoritative explored/current visibility, filtered observations, and legal last-seen memory.
- Patch-matched DAT rules and AoE2DE entity/widgetui assets through a byte-identical local import; open fallback remains playable.
- WEST/Dark Age desktop composition with dimetric world, task animations, composite town center, fog, command/selection panels, minimap, menus, hotkeys, pointer interactions, and landscape scaling.
- Versioned JSON public contracts; browser, built-in AI, JSONL subprocess, deadline subprocess, WebSocket, and MCP strategies share `applyCommand`.
- Full-state FNV-1a periodic checksums, command-stream records, Node verification, and browser playback.
- Process-isolated paired batches with configurable concurrency, Wilson 95% intervals, strategy hashes, per-match results, and replay records.
- Opt-in live model boundary using existing machine authentication: one ephemeral/no-tools/no-session call, thinking disabled, compact filtered input, one constrained action, 64 KiB process-output ceiling, 120-second deadline, and no stored observation/response/credential.

## Deliberately omitted

The target does not include Feudal+ ages, other civilizations, technologies, formations, naval play, campaigns, random-map parsing, multiplayer networking, diplomacy, trade, relics, gates/walls, or a genetic-algorithm framework. Mobile has no separate or simplified gameplay. Shadow layers now use the local decoder; player-color masks and outlines remain unavailable, with tinting as the documented team-color fallback.

## Measurements and gate evidence

Measured on calcifer:

- 16 paired-seed matches in 16 concurrent Node processes: **17,756 simulated seconds in 115.771 wall seconds (153.37× aggregate real time)**.
- Outcomes: 12 decided, 4 timeout draws; strategy-one mirror win rate 0.5, Wilson 95% interval `[0.2538, 0.7462]`.
- All 16 replay records re-simulated with **0 checksum failures**.
- Browser file replay reported `Replay verified: 1 checksums match` for a six-second imported-rules record.
- Headless Chrome software-rendering sample at 1920×1080: 4.0 fps, 8.3 MiB JS heap used / 13.8 MiB total after selection-ring pooling. A run without the forced SwiftShader flag reported 6.0 fps and 12.9/21.8 MiB, but headless Chrome still did not establish representative hardware acceleration; this is a known measurement limitation, not a desktop GPU claim.
- 844×390 landscape Chrome smoke retained the complete top bar, world, command frame, and minimap.
- Opt-in live-agent scenario completed successfully through the authenticated pi/OpenAI-Codex provider with one schema-valid command.

Batch artifacts are intentionally ignored under `.local/batches/phase6-16/`.

## Compatibility evidence and discrepancies

The importer integration resolves every consumed DAT graphic/rule and widgetui source, hashes inputs, and regenerates byte-identically. Viewer smoke tests loaded imported atlases and WEST UI without application console errors; selection, gather orders, fog expansion, and browser replay were exercised through Chrome DevTools Protocol. Timing, resource conservation, hidden information, pathing, combat release, protocol validation, and replay determinism have focused tests.

Known discrepancies are the missing player-color/outline layers, single-terrain ground without the multi-terrain blend masks, approximate tint-based team colors, missing fire/corpse delta overlays, and some mirror-AI matches that stalemate until the configured timeout.

The ground samples the imported DAT terrain texture (slot 0, `Grass`/`g_grs`) at the authored `terrain_dimensions` tile span; `terrain/blends` and `terrain/masks` are not consumed yet, so terrain-to-terrain transitions are absent rather than approximated. Farms are terrain too (slots 7 and 29, `Farm1`/`Farm Cnst1`): the DAT gives them no SLD, so they draw as their own patch of the isometric grid.

### Blocked on the pinned openage decoder

Three gaps share one cause and are worth recording together, because the fix for
one is likely the fix for all three.

- **The stable is not imported.** `b_west_stable_age2_x1.sld` raises
  `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'offset_x1' referenced before assignment`
  (sld.pyx:246) because a frame reaches the unimplemented outline branch before
  any graphics header is read. It is the only sprite of the whole spec that
  fails. The scout cavalry it trains is therefore also absent.
- **Sprite outlines are absent.** SLD frames carry an outline layer (bit 2 of
  `frame_type`; the barracks reports `0x1f`, so main + shadow + outline + damage
  + playercolor). AoE2DE draws the thin dark contour around units and buildings
  from it. openage's parser marks that branch `# TODO` and skips it.
- **Player-colour masks are absent**, as recorded above.

`tools/sld_shadow.py` already reads the container and the DXT4/BC4 blocks
without openage and handles the outline layer correctly by skipping it via the
layer length. Extending it to decode the BC1 main and mask layers would replace
the pinned decoder outright, which would recover the stable, the outlines, and
the player-colour masks in one step, and remove the last GPL dependency from the
import path.

### Audio import is unblocked

Patch-matched sound depots 813783 and 813787 are now recorded and documented.
`tools/wwise_pck.py` reads their AKPK indices, while `tools/import_audio.py`
hashes the `sounds.json` event name with Wwise's lowercase FNV-1 ID, follows the
HIRC Event → Play Action → container/sound graph, and extracts only referenced
DIDX media. The externally installed, permissively licensed `vgmstream-cli`
then decodes that media to deterministic browser-playable WAV without vendored
decoder code.

The first consumed cue is the widget-authored `button_ui` alias:
`Play_Button_UI` resolves in bank 232745270 to media 56802692 and decodes to a
0.239456-second mono 22.05 kHz cue. It plays for HUD command/menu clicks in the
owned-content mode; the open fallback remains silent. Integration tests verify
the source resolution and byte-identical regeneration. Broader simulation
sound triggers and localized unit acknowledgements are not wired yet.

## Verification

```bash
npm test
npm run build
npm run test:import
npm run batch -- --matches 16 --concurrency 16 --seed-start 100 --max-time 1800 --out .local/batches/phase6-16
npm run test:live-agent   # opt-in; requires valid existing machine provider auth
```

## Smallest recommended next milestone

Extend the local SLD decoder to BC1 main/player-color/outline layers, then add imported terrain blend masks. This would recover the stable, accurate team colors and contours while removing the remaining openage dependency, without expanding gameplay scope.
